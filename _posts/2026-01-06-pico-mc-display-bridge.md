Use 2 Raspberry Pi Pico boards to add per channel and global display to any Mackie Control compatible MIDI controller.
Also adds MIDI stream processing. You insert this project between your MIDI control surface and your DAW computer.

I managed to break my hardware, so I have not updated or tested this project in a while. If there is any interest
in seeing this project updated, please file an issue and I will see if I can revive my hardware. If there is no
request to update this project in 2026, I will archive the project.
