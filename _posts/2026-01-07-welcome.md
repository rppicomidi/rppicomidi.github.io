# Welcome to the [rppicomidi Website](https://github.com/rppicomidi/rppicomidi.github.io)
This website is designed to help you find information about
the [rppicomidi GitHub repositories (repos)](https://github.com/rppicomidi/).

This site will update as new repos are added and old repos
are updated or archived.

# How to Use this Website
This website is structured as a blog. In most cases, each post is about a single GitHub repo.
The post has a link to the GitHub repo in the first heading. A brief description of
the repo follows. I may pin to the top of the home page 1-6 posts about repos that are my current favorites.

Desktop and wide tablet browsers display the site table of contents under the avatar icon to the left side of the page
or under "Contents" to the right side of the page.
Mobile browsers or narrow sized desktop browsers display the table of contents in response to pressing the menu "hamburger" icon,
or in response to clicking the "Contents" button near the top of individual post entries. The table of contents
entries can help you navigate this site and are described in the following sections.

Below the table of contents on the left side of the screen, there are 3 icons. The black and white circle will
toggle between light and dark mode. The GitHub icon will take you to the rppicomidi GitHub home page. The last
icon is an RSS feed.

## HOME
Click this to return to the Website home page.
## CATEGORIES
Each repo will have a category like MIDI-DIY-Project, Graphics-Firmware-Library, and more, followed
by a sub-category that is the name of the repo itself. Posts that describe update the repo will
all be gathered under the same categories to make them easier to find.
The categories may evolve over time as I better learn how to use this. You can find posts
related to each category by clicking a category link.
## TAGS
There are tags that specify general categories and features like usb-midi-host, usb-midi-device,
bluetooth-midi, serial-port-midi, usb-tools, usb-debugging, and so forth. Clicking a tag
will show posts related to the tag name.
## ARCHIVES
You will find the timeline of all posts to this website by clicking ARCHIVES.
## ABOUT
Describes a bit more about me, and about the rppicomidi GitHub page, and about how I built this website.
