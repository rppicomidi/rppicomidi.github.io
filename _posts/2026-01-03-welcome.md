# Website Under Construction
I am rebuiling the rppicomidi.github.io website. Please be patient as
I repopulate it with content.

# Welcome to the rppicomidi Website
This website is designed to help you find information about
the [rppicomidi GitHub repositories (repos)](https://github.com/rppicomidi/).

This site will update as new repos are added and old repos
are updated or archived.

# How to Use this Website
This website is structured as a blog. In most cases, each post is about a single GitHub repo.
The post has a link to the GitHub repo in the first heading. A brief description of
the repo follows.

The Navigation area under the rppicomidi avatar picture has several items
that you can click to help you navigate.
## HOME
Click this to return to the Website home page.
## CATEGORIES
Each repo will have one or two categories like Hardware, MIDI-DIY-Project, Demo, Documentation,
and more. The categories may evolve over time as I better learn how to use this. You can find posts
related to each category by clicking a tag.
## TAGS
There are tags that specify general categories like usb-midi-host, usb-midi-device,
bluetooth-midi, serial-port-midi, usb-tools, usb-debugging, and so forth.

TODO: Each GitHub repo should have a unique tag. When I have news about a specific
repo, it should show up on the home page under the pinned posts. If you want
to find posts about a specific repo, look for its tag. 
## ARCHIVES
You will find the timeline of all posts to this website by clicking ARCHIVES.
## ABOUT
Describes a bit more about me, and about the rppicomidi GitHub page, and about how I built this website.
