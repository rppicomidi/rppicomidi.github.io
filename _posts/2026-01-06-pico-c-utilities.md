# [pico-c-utilities](https://github.com/rppicomidi/pico-c-utilities)
A collection of C and C++ functions for console I/O and other useful things for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

So far, this "collection" has only one function in it: `int getsn(char* cp, int size)`, a function for getting a character string from the console.
